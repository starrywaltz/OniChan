<h1>Welcome to Oni-Chan</h1>


<p>I created this website as a way to practice my own Japanese, as well as help others to learn. The resourse are based around Genki 1 and 2 3rd edition and I will be adding content for Tobira and Quartet in the future. Currently there is a lot under construction, so please bear with me whilst I work on perfecting the content.</p>

<h3>About me</h3>
I have been studying Japanese on and off for 15 years, some formal education, some informal self teaching. I also spent 3 months working on a ski resort in Hakuba, Nagano. I am currently completing my first year of university studying towards a degree in Japanese Studies.

<h3>A special thanks</h3>
Thank you to the superb teachers of Dalarna University for their excellent teaching, and the students of Japanese 2 2021 for being an amazing class and helping me with my content.
<br><br>
<h2>Enjoy!</h2>
